Data: (if connected)
	send groundstation y json
local_starage: (if disconected)
	store incoming data in log file sequentially
	


connected ---> Parse() until disconection
		
		
disconected --> Local_storage()


timestamp, data, data, . . ., data (sort by timestamp to prevent data disorder?)


local_storage() keeps saving but new data is now transferred to the csv instead
from csv we take new data sequentially and send to ground station.

while True:
	if(disconnected)
		append to file
	else
		for lines in file:
			send lines[i]
		write to file
		send file


*update Idea*
-Use multithreading for data read/write
-Use environment variables on Windows/Linux as to not manually change the code
between platforms.
